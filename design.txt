For saas api we provide a restful check for authentication based on encrypted tokens

Version 1:
Basically the site being accessed has a secret we gave it plus a public id, the client requests auth from sociacl
sociacl will use the publicid and client info to verify access
if access is granted the secret will be used to send a token back
the site can then validate the token based on the the secret and the client info

Version 2:
we use forward encryption to guarantee only this session is visible to the client and not previous matching ones
